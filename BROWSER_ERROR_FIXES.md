# Browser Error Fixes Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Multiple GoTrueClient Instances

**Problem**: Multiple components were creating their own Supabase client instances, causing the warning:

```
Multiple GoTrueClient instances detected in the same browser context
```

**Root Cause**:

- `Header.tsx` was creating its own Supabase client
- `Dashboard.tsx` was creating its own Supabase client
- This caused multiple auth clients to compete for the same storage key

**Solution**:

- Updated both components to use the shared singleton Supabase client from `packages/shared/src/lib/supabase.ts`
- Enhanced the shared client with proper singleton pattern to prevent multiple instances
- Added unique storage key (`park-angel-auth-token`) to avoid conflicts

### 2. React Router Deprecation Warnings

**Problem**: React Router was showing future flag warnings:

```
⚠️ React Router Future Flag Warning: React Router will begin wrapping state updates in `React.startTransition` in v7
⚠️ React Router Future Flag Warning: Relative route resolution within Splat routes is changing in v7
```

**Solution**:

- Added future flags to `BrowserRouter` in `main.tsx`:
  - `v7_startTransition: true`
  - `v7_relativeSplatPath: true`

### 3. Console Noise Reduction

**Problem**: Debug logging was creating unnecessary console output in production

**Solution**:

- Removed debug import from `main.tsx`
- Added environment check to only log debug info in development mode
- Kept essential environment detection logging but made it conditional

## Files Modified

1. **packages/admin-dashboard/src/components/Header.tsx**
   - Removed local Supabase client creation
   - Updated to use shared singleton client

2. **packages/admin-dashboard/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx**
   - Removed local Supabase client creation
   - Updated to use shared singleton client

3. **packages/admin-dashboard/src/main.tsx**
   - Added React Router future flags
   - Removed debug import

4. **packages/shared/src/lib/supabase.ts**
   - Implemented proper singleton pattern
   - Added unique storage key for auth
   - Made debug logging conditional on environment

## Benefits

- ✅ Eliminated multiple GoTrueClient instances warning
- ✅ Resolved React Router deprecation warnings
- ✅ Reduced console noise
- ✅ Improved performance by using singleton pattern
- ✅ Better auth session management with unique storage key
- ✅ Future-proofed for React Router v7

## Testing

The fixes ensure:

- Single Supabase client instance across the entire application
- Proper auth session persistence and management
- Clean console output without warnings
- Compatibility with future React Router versions

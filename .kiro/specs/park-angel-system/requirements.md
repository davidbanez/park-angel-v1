# Park Angel - Comprehensive Parking Management System Requirements

## Introduction

Park Angel is a comprehensive parking management system designed to streamline parking operations across multiple user types and platforms. The system consists of four interconnected applications: an Admin Dashboard (web), Operator Dashboard (web and mobile), POS App (iOS and Android mobile), and Client Mobile App (web and mobile). The system supports three types of parking: Hosted Parking (AirBnb-style private parking spaces), Street Parking (on-street public parking), and Parking Facility (off-street parking garages/facilities). The system will utilize Supabase as the backend database and provide real-time parking management, direct payment processing to Park Angel's account, reporting, and enforcement capabilities including towing and clamping functionality. The system uses a hierarchical parking structure: Location → Section → Zone → Spot.

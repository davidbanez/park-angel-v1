# Node.js 20 Upgrade Fix Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for completing the Node.js 20 upgrade for the Park Angel system. The upgrade has been partially completed but there are still 285 TypeScript compilation errors that need to be resolved.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete Node.js 20 Runtime Upgrade

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to run on Node.js 20+ so that I can benefit from improved performance and latest JavaScript features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is built THEN it should compile without TypeScript errors
2. WHEN npm install is run THEN all dependencies should install successfully
3. WHEN the shared package is built THEN it should generate proper type definitions
4. WHEN other packages import from shared THEN they should have proper type safety

### Requirement 2: Fix Database Type Synchronization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want database queries to return properly typed results so that I can work with type-safe data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Supabase queries are executed THEN they should return typed data instead of SelectQueryError
2. WHEN database types are imported THEN they should match the actual database schema
3. WHEN services use database queries THEN they should have proper type inference
4. WHEN type checking is performed THEN there should be no unknown type errors

### Requirement 3: Resolve Service Layer Type Issues

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all service layer code to compile without errors so that the application can be built and deployed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN service classes are instantiated THEN they should implement their interfaces correctly
2. WHEN service methods are called THEN they should have proper parameter and return types
3. WHEN services interact with each other THEN they should have compatible type definitions
4. WHEN the parking type system is used THEN all logic classes should implement the same interface

### Requirement 4: Fix Type Export Conflicts

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to import types without conflicts so that I can use them across different parts of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN types are exported from index files THEN there should be no duplicate export errors
2. WHEN types are imported in services THEN they should resolve to the correct definitions
3. WHEN similar types exist in different modules THEN they should be properly namespaced
4. WHEN the build process runs THEN all type exports should be valid

### Requirement 5: Maintain Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want existing functionality to continue working after the upgrade so that no features are broken.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the upgrade is complete THEN all existing APIs should continue to work
2. WHEN tests are run THEN they should pass with the new Node.js version
3. WHEN the application starts THEN it should initialize without runtime errors
4. WHEN core features are used THEN they should function as expected
